# Pong in Elm

I didn't write this.  I got this from [pdamoc](https://gist.github.com/pdamoc)'s 
[gist](https://gist.github.com/pdamoc/fd29925b8e20dd92e91c5b75e6c3711e) and make
some tweaks to it.

## To run

```
elm package install --yes
elm reactor
```

Then open the url the reactor shows.  Click on "Pong.elm".
